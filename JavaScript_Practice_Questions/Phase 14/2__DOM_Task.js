// ========================================================================================================================================================

// ========================================================================= EASY =========================================================================

// 1. Color-Cycling Button
// Add a button to the page and a list (array) of at least four colour names in your JavaScript code. Every time the button is clicked, change the page's background colour to the next colour in your list. When you reach the end of the list, the next click should loop back around to the first colour again.

// 2. Live Character Counter
// Add a text input or textarea to the page, along with a small piece of text below it that shows how many characters the user has typed so far. As the user types or deletes letters, this counter should update right away, with no button click or page refresh needed.

// 3. Read More / Read Less Toggle
// Add a paragraph of text that is long enough to be shortened, along with a small link or button labelled "Read More." When clicked, the full paragraph should become visible and the label should change to "Read Less." Clicking it again should hide the extra text and switch the label back to "Read More."

// 4. Click Counter App
// Display a number on the page, starting at 0, along with a button labelled something like "Click Me." Every time the button is clicked, the number shown should go up by exactly one. Make sure the number on the page always matches how many times the button has actually been clicked.

// 5. Add Items to a To-Do List
// Build a simple to-do list with a text input box, an "Add" button, and an empty list (a <ul>) below them. When the user types something in the input and clicks "Add," a new list item showing that text should appear at the bottom of the list, and the input box should clear itself so the next task can be typed in.

// 6. Delete a Single To-Do Item
// Using the to-do list from the previous task, add a small "Delete" button next to every item, including new ones added later. Clicking the delete button on any one item should remove only that specific item from the list, while every other item stays exactly where it is.

// 7. Mark To-Do Items as Done
// On your to-do list, make it so clicking directly on the text of a task (not the delete button) marks that task as completed - for example, by drawing a line through the text or fading its colour. Clicking the same task again should undo this and make it look normal again.

// 8. Live Celsius to Fahrenheit Converter
// Add an input box where the user can type a temperature in Celsius, and a piece of text nearby that shows the same temperature converted to Fahrenheit. As soon as the user types or changes the Celsius value, the Fahrenheit value should update right away, using the formula F = C × 9/5 + 32.

// 9. Live Digital Clock
// Show the current time somewhere on your page, for example as "10:45:32 AM." Write code that updates this displayed time automatically, once every second, so it always matches the real time without the user ever needing to refresh the page.

// 10. Light/Dark Mode Switch
// Add a single button to your page that switches between a light theme and a dark theme. Clicking it should toggle one class name on the <body> element, and your CSS should use that class to change the background and text colours for the whole page at once, not just one small part of it.

// 11. Required Field Inline Errors
// Build a simple form with at least two input fields marked as required. If the user clicks submit while leaving any required field empty, show a short red error message right under that specific field, such as "This field is required." If the user then fills the field in and tries again, that field's error message should disappear.

// 12. Image Next/Previous Swapper
// Display one image on the page along with "Next" and "Previous" buttons, and keep a list (array) of at least four image links in your JavaScript code. Clicking "Next" should change the picture shown to the next one in your list, and clicking "Previous" should go back to the one before it. Going past the last or first image should loop around to the other end of the list.

// 13. Save and Load a Note
// Build a simple notes box: one large textarea where a user can type some text, and a "Save" button next to it. When "Save" is clicked, store the typed text in the browser's localStorage, which is a small storage space the browser keeps for your website. Then, write code that runs as soon as the page loads, which checks localStorage for any saved note and, if one exists, automatically fills the textarea with it - so the note is still there even after the page is refreshed or the browser is closed and reopened.

// 14. FAQ Accordion
// Build a small FAQ section with at least four questions, where each question is followed by a hidden answer. Clicking a question should reveal its answer and hide the others, so only one answer is visible on the page at any time. Clicking that same question again should close its answer back up.

// 15. Tabbed Content Switcher
// Create at least three tab buttons (for example, "Home," "About," and "Contact") and a content area below them. Clicking any tab should show only the content that belongs to it, hide the content for the other tabs, and visually highlight the clicked tab so the user can tell which one is currently active.

// 16. Star Rating Widget
// Display five star icons or symbols in a row. When the user clicks any star, that star and every star before it (to its left) should turn a highlighted colour, while the stars after it stay plain, like a normal 1-to-5 star rating. Clicking a different star should update the highlighting to match the new rating right away.

// 17. Live List Search Filter
// Display a list of at least eight names, with a search input box above it. As the user types into the search box, the list on screen should automatically update to show only the names containing the typed text, hiding every name that doesn't match. Clearing the search box should bring the full list back.

// 18. Live Password Strength Meter
// Add a password input field and a small label beside it that shows "Weak," "Medium," or "Strong." As the user types their password, check things like how long it is and whether it includes numbers or special characters, and update the label live so it always matches how strong the current password looks.

// 19. Click-Outside-to-Close Modal
// Build a button that opens a modal popup box in the middle of the page when clicked, with a semi-transparent overlay behind it. The modal should be closable two ways: by clicking a small "X" close button inside it, or by clicking anywhere on the dark overlay outside it. Clicking inside the modal box itself should not close it.

// 20. Custom Dropdown Menu
// Instead of using a normal HTML <select> element, build your own dropdown using a button and a hidden list of options. Clicking the button should show or hide the list of options. Clicking any option in the list should close the dropdown and update the button's text to show whichever option was chosen.

// 21. Mini Shopping Cart Counter
// Display at least three products, each with its own name, price, and "Add to Cart" button. Keep a running total of how many items have been added and their combined price, showing both numbers somewhere on the page. Every time any "Add to Cart" button is clicked, both numbers should update right away to reflect the new total.

// 22. Sortable Data Table
// Build a table with at least three columns (for example, Name, Age, and City) and several rows of sample data. Add click handling on each column header so clicking it sorts all the rows by that column. Clicking the same header again should reverse the order, switching between ascending and descending each time.

// 23. Stopwatch with Start/Pause/Reset
// Build a stopwatch that displays elapsed time (for example, in seconds) along with three buttons: Start, Pause, and Reset. Start should begin counting up from wherever it left off, Pause should freeze the timer exactly where it is without losing the current time, and Reset should bring the displayed time back down to zero.

// 24. Multi-Step Form Wizard
// Build a form split into at least three separate steps (for example, Step 1: personal details, Step 2: address, Step 3: confirmation), showing only one step at a time. Add "Next" and "Back" buttons to move between steps, along with a small progress indicator (such as "Step 2 of 3") that always shows exactly where the user currently is.

// 25. Auto-Dismissing Toast Notifications
// Add a button that, when clicked, creates a small message box (a "toast") that appears on screen, for example saying "Saved successfully!" This message should disappear by itself after about three seconds, with no need for the user to close it manually. Clicking the button several times should be able to show a new toast each time.

// 26. Lightbox Image Gallery
// Display a row of small thumbnail images. Clicking any thumbnail should open a bigger version of that same image in an overlay covering the page, along with a close button (or a way to click outside the image) to dismiss it and return to the gallery.

// 27. Persistent To-Do List
// Upgrade your earlier to-do list app so it remembers its tasks even after the page is refreshed or closed. Every time a task is added, deleted, or marked as done, save the full, current list of tasks into localStorage using JSON.stringify() to turn the array into plain text. When the page loads, read that saved text back out of localStorage, turn it back into an array using JSON.parse(), and rebuild the to-do list on the page from it.

// 28. Remembered Theme Preference
// Upgrade your earlier light/dark mode toggle so that whichever theme the user picks is saved into localStorage. Then write code that runs as soon as the page loads, which checks localStorage for a saved theme and applies it immediately - so the page always opens in whichever mode the user picked last, instead of always starting in the default light mode.

// ========================================================================= HARD =========================================================================

// 29. Render-Function To-Do App
// Rebuild your to-do list app so that all of its tasks live in one JavaScript array of objects (each object holding a task's text and whether it's completed), instead of being scattered across the page's HTML. Write a single render() function that clears the visible list and rebuilds it completely from this array every time something changes - whenever a task is added, deleted, or marked done, update the array first, then simply call render() again to redraw everything.

// 30. Infinite Scrolling List
// Build a long list of items (for example, 20 numbered items to start) on a scrollable page. Detect when the user has scrolled close to the bottom, and when that happens, automatically generate and add the next batch of items (for example, 20 more) to the bottom of the list, so the list keeps growing the further down the page the user scrolls.

// 31. API-Powered Dashboard Cards
// Build a small dashboard page that, as soon as it loads, shows a loading message while it fetches a list of items from a public API. Once the data arrives, replace the loading message with one card (or table row) per item, showing useful details such as a title and description. If the request fails, show a friendly error message instead of leaving the page stuck on "Loading..."

// 32. Debounced Live API Search
// Build a search input that searches a public API as the user types. Instead of sending a new request on every single keystroke, wait until the user has stopped typing for a short pause (for example, 400 milliseconds) before sending the request, so the API isn't overwhelmed with requests while someone is still typing.

// 33. Decoupled Cart via Custom Events
// Build an "Add to Cart" button that, instead of directly updating a cart display itself, creates and fires (dispatches) a custom event called itemAdded, carrying the product's name as extra data on the event. Separately, write a completely different piece of code that listens for the itemAdded event and updates a cart summary whenever it hears that event - these two pieces of code should never call each other directly.

// 34. Drag-and-Drop Sortable List
// Build a to-do list (or any simple list) where the user can click and hold any item, drag it up or down, and drop it into a new position in the same list. After dropping, the order shown on the page should permanently reflect wherever the item was dropped.

// 35. Kanban Board with Draggable Cards
// Build a simple Kanban board with three columns labelled "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done," each starting with a few sample task cards. Let the user drag any card out of one column and drop it into a different column, moving the task from one stage to another, and make sure it stays put wherever it was dropped.

// 36. Form Validation via Event Delegation
// Build a signup form with several different input fields (for example, name, email, and password). Instead of attaching a separate 'check this field' listener to every individual input,  attach just one listener to the whole form. Inside that one listener, work out which specific field triggered the event and run the right validation check for it, showing an error message next to it if something is wrong.

// 37. Lazy-Loaded Image Gallery
// Build a gallery containing many images, but don't actually load any image's real picture file until that image is about to be seen on screen. Use the IntersectionObserver feature to detect when each image scrolls into view, and only then set its src attribute to the real image link - this avoids wasting time and data loading images the user hasn't scrolled to yet.

// 38. Nested Comment Thread
// Build a simplified comment section where every comment has a small "Reply" link or button under it. Clicking "Reply" should let the user type a new comment that gets added directly underneath (nested inside) the comment they replied to - and this should keep working no matter how many levels deep someone keeps replying.

// 39. localStorage vs sessionStorage Visit Tracker
// Build a small page that counts and displays how many times it has been visited. Store this visit count in localStorage, increasing it by one every time the page loads, so the count keeps growing even after the browser is closed and reopened. Alongside it, keep a separate count using sessionStorage the same way, and show both numbers side by side. Add a "Clear All Data" button that uses localStorage.clear() and sessionStorage.clear() to reset both counts to zero. Try refreshing the page a few times, then fully closing and reopening the browser, and compare how the two counts behave differently.
